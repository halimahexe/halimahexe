## My Learning Journey

I learned the basics of web development on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and built on this by completing the prerequisites for Founders and Coders software foundation bootcamp:

- üßë‚Äçüíª [Personal website](https://halimahexe.github.io/FAC-Website) - my first project explaining who I am and why I want to move into tech
- üêà‚Äç‚¨õ [Cat game](https://halimahexe.github.io/Cat-Game) - a simple game made with HTML, CSS and JS all about my favourite animals: cats!

After I got on to the bootcamp, I practised my skills by creating:

- üé® [Colour palette generator](https://halimahexe.github.io/ColourPalette) - automatically generates various colour palettes (created using HTML, CSS and JS). This is still a WIP.

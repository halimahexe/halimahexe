## My Learning Journey

I learned the basics of web development on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and built on this by completing the prerequisites for Founders and Coders software foundation bootcamp:

- 🧑‍💻 [Personal website](https://halimahexe.github.io/FAC-Website) - my first project explaining who I am and why I want to move into tech
- 🐈‍⬛ [Cat game](https://halimahexe.github.io/Cat-Game) - a simple game made with HTML, CSS and JS all about my favourite animals: cats!

After I got on to the bootcamp, I practised my skills by creating:

- 🎨 [Colour palette generator](https://halimahexe.github.io/ColourPalette) - automatically generates various colour palettes (created using HTML, CSS and JS). This is still a WIP.
- <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Pok%C3%A9_Ball_icon.svg/240px-Pok%C3%A9_Ball_icon.svg.png" alt="pokeball" height="16px" width="16px"> [Poke-Search page](https://halimahexe.github.io/poke-search) - learning how to use fetch by creating a Pokemon search page that returns the pokemon and element types.

I have pair programmed the following projects:
- 🤖 [Hadel Bot](https://github.com/fac30/discord-ai-bot--halimah-adel) - a Discord AI bot that takes prompts from users and returns responses from OpenAI API (created using Node.js, Discord.js, OpenAI).
- 🌐 [Lingo Agency website](https://fac30.github.io/Agency-Phoenix-Halimah) - a fake agency website (created using HTML, CSS and JS).
- 🤖 [ChatGPT front-end clone](https://fac30.github.io/chatgpt-clone--halimah-andrei-adriana-loza) - a front-end clone for ChatGPT (created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and OpenAI).
- 🌐 [Deployment to AWS](https://github.com/fac30/halimah-kieran-oleg-andrei-unschool-aws) - practised deploying a simple website to AWS and linking GitHub to it so it would automatically update (created using AWS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

I'm currently working on:
- [JetSavr Travel App](https://github.com/fac30/travel-app--william-halimah) - a web app that displays flights and currency exchange data (created using PugJS, ExpressJS, CSS and APIs).
